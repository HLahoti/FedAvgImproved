# Improvements to FedAvg

<h1 align="center" id="title">Improving FedAvg</h1>

<p id="description">Federated learning is an important and emerging field of interest in machine learning. It allows privacy-centric model training on resource-constrained devices while preserving network bandwidth. While the vanilla FedAvg algorithm performs very well with IID data distributions, the client's performance drops rapidly as the data becomes more and more non-IID. Thus changes need to be made to make the algorithm work well enough in such cases as well. 
  
In this repository, we implement certain improvements to the vanilla FedAvg algorithm based on this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00582

The full report of the experiments performed and the outputs seen can be found in the report in the repository.
